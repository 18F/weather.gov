# 4. We will use NOAA WOC for hosting

Date: 2023-07-13

## Status

Proposed

## Context

weather.gov has to be hosted somewhere in order to be available on the internet.
Where we choose to host the product can have significant impacts on what we are
able to build. Ideally, we would like to use a hosting provider that is already
approved within NOAA/NWS rather than procuring something new.

## Decision

We have chosen to use the NOAA WOC as our hosting provider. It is already
approved and supported within NOAA, and it is built on a large-scale commercial
cloud provider that gives us a lot of freedom with what we build.

## Consequences

The WOC introduces another relationship and that could sometimes result in
delays getting something done because we need their support or approval.
