### Executive Champions
  - **Led by:** Ken Graham, NWS Director and Michelle Mainelli, NWS Acting Deputy Director
  - **They are responsible for** setting organizational priorities and allocating funds, attention, and people across many initiatives in order to maintain its critical services, maximize its impact, and support its people.
  - **They are not responsible for** directing the strategy or defining success for Weather.gov 2.0, nor are they responsible for how the site gets built. They should always have visibility into progress, provide feedback, and can at any point veto strategic decisions.

### Primary Champions
  - **Led by:** George Jungbluth, Acting Director of the Office of Dissemination and Jason Tuell, NWS Eastern Region Director
  - **They are responsible for** aligning Weather.gov 2.0’s vision, strategy, and rollout within the organization. They work across the org to get buy-in and support, they assign resources, and monitor progress towards outcomes.
  - **They are not responsible for** how the strategy is executed, e.g. what’s built and how it’s built. They should always have visibility into progress, provide feedback, and can at any point veto critical executional decisions.

### Product Team
  - **Led by:** Kari Sheets, Weather.gov 2.0 Product Owner and Shad Keene, Weather.gov 2.0 Deputy Product Owner
  - **They are responsible for** weather.gov 2.0’s strategy, delivery, and impact on users. They prioritize, execute, uphold standards and compliance, and communicate out progress regularly.
  - **They are not responsible for** the data, content, and integrity of guidance that NWS provides to the public and partners. 

### Subject Matter Experts
  - **They are responsible for** implementing and supporting weather.gov 2.0 as it’s being developed and rolled out.
  - **They are not responsible for** the weather.gov site experience, bugs. However they will be active contributors to making the site better.

### How will decisions be made
The goal is to inform strategic decisions based on user needs and then validate them in testing. This process requires 
  - the tightest possible feedback loop between the product team leading the work and the primary champions overseeing its success 
  - a consensus or consent-based model where explicit commitment is sought from a majority over complete unanimity

Otherwise, the product team will spend more time justifying the work rather than doing it and learning from it.

### How will feedback on the product be sought and given
The end user is prioritized over everyone. 

The product team is responsible for getting feedback regularly from users, considering a starting place that you only need to test with 5 users ([source](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/why-you-only-need-to-test-with-5-users/)). Additional feedback from subject matter experts in areas such as data, policy, security, technology will be sought as needed or as encouraged by the primary champions in order to provide greater context.

However, proactive feedback does not require an immediate reaction. The product team is responsible for hearing all feedback and considering it in their execution.
